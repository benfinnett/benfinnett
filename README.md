### Student • Python Programmer • Project Manager

I am always looking to learn new concepts, ideas, and knowledge to expand the breadth and depth of what I know. As a child I was familiarising myself with programming using Scratch, before moving onto Python in my teenage years at age 14. It's safe to say I have always had a passion for computers and technology. 

Since then I have dedicated my education to computer science and software design and development, gaining work experience at multiple different companies including Glaxo Smith Kline, GKFX Online, Nomura Banking, and Scope Markets where I shadowed developers and staff to learn about how each company made use of software within their own industry. Through education I have focused on becoming an expert in Python, as well as exploring other programming languages and technologies such as Java, HTML, CSS, JS and PHP. During this time I have discovered a love for algorithm design and analysis, as well as a more business-sided approach of project management and application/project design. 

I have been fortunate enough to work with very large YouTube and Twitch content creators, managing projects to provide content and online gaming services for their communities. I've been the leader of a staff team of over 70 people from across the globe and have spearheaded multiple projects with thousands of dollars worth of investment.
